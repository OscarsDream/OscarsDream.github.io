I have been thinking about the type of Civil Society I would like to live in.  
With the help of today's tools I used ChatGPT to help me create this website.
ChatGPT helped me figure out a domain name that was currently available.  https://civara.us/
ChatGPT helped me decide on a hosting service so I am using:  https://www.namecheap.com

To Do
- setup mail for civara.us
- activate Contact Us using a civara.us email
- The domain was registered on 7/26/2025.  I still need to finish the namecheap.com setup and add my vision.
